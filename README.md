From there it will show visualizations of the minimum average daily temperature on Mars by month, first in month order, then in order of coldest to warmest months. Next is a visualization of the average daily atmospheric pressure by month, first in month order, then in order of lowest to highest pressure. Finally, a visualization of the daily minimum temperature per terrestrial day, from which we can estimate the terrestrial days per Mars year.
